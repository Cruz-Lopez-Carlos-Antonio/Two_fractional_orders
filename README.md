# Fractional Neutron Point Kinetics Equations with Different Fractional orders
The present repository contains the MATLAB codes developed to solve the Fractional Neutron Point Kinetic Equations (FNPKE) considering different fractional orders. These codes were described in the article: *"A New Compartmental Fractional Neutron Point Kinetic Equations with different fractional orders"*, which was recently submitted to the **Nuclear Engineering and Design**.

Mathematical and algorithmical generalities of the codes are described in the following lines with the purpose to provide some insight of the developed work. Nevertheless, a more detailed discussion is provided in the submitted article.
